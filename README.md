# Angular 9 TodoMVC

TodoMVC implementation based on [Angular](https://angular.io) version 9. 

This repo is used to explore the in-depth of Angular, like AOT, compiler, view tree, change detection etc.

## Development

* Run `npm install` first.
* Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Run `npm run build` to build the production bundled app.
* Run `npm run start` to start the production bundled app.
* Run `npm run build:aot` to build the AOT version of the production and expose the `ngfactory` etc.
* Run `npm run start:aot` to start a `es-dev-server` to serve the AOT version without bundling.
